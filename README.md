# A False Memory

> Your world remembers everything.

A psychological horror mod for Minecraft (NeoForge 1.21.1).

## What Is This?

You play. You build. You survive.

Something is watching. Learning. Adapting.

By the end, you won't know if you're the hunter or the hunted.

## Features

- Personalized psychological horror (no two playthroughs are the same)
- Adaptive entity that learns your playstyle
- Haunting events based on your actual gameplay
- A final confrontation with yourself
- No jump scares. Just dread.

## Installation

1. Download the mod
2. Install in your NeoForge mods folder
3. Play alone
4. Don't say we didn't warn you

## Configuration

Use Mod Menu + Cloth Config to adjust intensity if needed.

## Play Style

- Best in singleplayer
- Best at night
- Best when you don't know what's coming

## Support

> **This is an early alpha. Bugs expected. The core systems (memory tracking, adaptive combat, Lost Memories) are implemented. Please report issues and feedback.**
